### Demo to show how to create a CRUD - Blog app - in Django with DRF - DjangoRestFramework - and REACT..  

#### Based on tutorials:  
	- https://scotch.io/@CleverProgrammer/how-to-make-a-django-blog-app  	
    - https://www.techiediaries.com/django-crud-generic-views/  

#### Get started:
- Install 'node' and 'npm'
- Create a virtualenv  
- Clone the  project
- Run:  
-- pip install -r requirements.txt  
-- ./manage.py makemigrations  
-- ./manage.py migrate  
-- ./manage.py createsuperuser  
- Run the project  
-- ./manage.py runserver
- Go to /frontend/gui folder
- Rum 'npm start'

TODO's:
- Once this is just a proof of concept, several things were left out:  
-- Using a proper database engine, instead of 'sqlite'.  
-- Creating proper separated environment configs to DEV and deploy, in order to protect access credentials and project SECRET_KEY.
